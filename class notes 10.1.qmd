## Revisiting Scooby

When looking at `setting_terrain` vs another variable, make sure you considered `NA`s. Let's consider that variable and `arrested`.

```{r}
sum(is.na(scooby$setting_terrain))
sum(is.na(scooby$arrested)) 
```

Why are there so many missing values for `arrested`? Let's looks at those.

```{r}
missing_arrested <- scooby %>% 
  filter(is.na(arrested))
```
