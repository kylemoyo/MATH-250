## A bit about hex codes for colors

The first row in the `color_survey` set has color `#4864af`. What does this mean?? We read this in pairs, giving us red, green, and blue components. Here, 48 red. These values are in *hexadecimal*, or just *hex*, which means they're base 16. 

The hex number 48 means 4 sixteens and 8 ones. This is 16*4 + 8 = 72. 

What about the blue component, af? In hex, a is 10, b is 11 etc., so af is 10 sixteens and 15 ones. This is 175 in decimal.  

If you put the color code in a code chunk, RStudio will show it to you in the source but not the rendered version.

```{r}
"#4864af" 
```
