## Filtering `NA`s

The `penguins` data set includes some missing values which can complicate things. How many `bill_len` are missing?

```{r}
is.na(penguins$bill_len)
sum(is.na(penguins$bill_len))
mean(is.na(penguins$bill_len))
```

About 0.6% are missing. Two total. Let's filter the set to just keep these. The obvious thing doesn't work.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(bill_len == NA) # no matches

penguins %>% 
  filter(is.na(bill_len))
```

We keep non-missing values like so:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bill_len)) %>% 
  head()
```
